# Dynamic Programming (DP) Repository

This repository showcases solutions to a variety of problems using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a powerful technique for solving optimization and combinatorial problems. It includes explanations, code implementations, and examples to help understand and apply DP concepts.

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions for future reference. It is especially useful for problems with:

1. **Optimal Substructure**: The solution of a problem can be constructed from solutions to its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: The problem can be broken into smaller subproblems, which are solved multiple times.

## Repository Structure

- **Basics**: Introductory examples, like Fibonacci, Factorial, etc.
- **Problems**:
  - Knapsack Problem
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
  - Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)
  - Matrix Chain Multiplication
  - Partition Problems
- **Resources**: Tutorials, references, and additional reading material.
